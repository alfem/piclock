PiClock
=======

Customizable Alarm Clock powered by Raspberry Pi


Piclock will be your bedroom companion. Designed to be (almost) invisible when you are sleeping but becaming both a nice alarm clock and a source of information for your daily tasks.


In its tiny (3.5') monitor you will see many different screens:

- The typical (but customizable) clock 
- News from your favourite sources
- Personal Agenda and tasks
- Weather forecast (I know it is never right, but it will be there anyway :-)
- ... (add user contributed modules here)


A neat rotative encoder will allow you to navigate thru these screens.

A PIR (or ultrasound) sensor will switch on/off the PiClock monitor when you are sleeping.

Finally, a lovely enclosure will pack everything inside, including an extra USB port to charge your smartphone.

IMPROVEMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS

- Add a "sheep counting" module to help you fall asleep  (thanks my friend Mantos)
- Add a microphone for snore detection (and perhaps making counter-snore oises) 
- Test pillow-speakers (they do not need amplification)
